## Role du reseau p2p 

### Data Distribution and Training:
- Distribute segments of the AI model or dataset to different nodes for local training.
- Facilitate the training process on individual nodes and manage the synchronization of trained model weights.

### Node Communication and Management:
        
- Handle communication between nodes for data transfer, progress updates, and coordination.
- Manage node discovery, connectivity, and availability within the network.

### Resource Allocation:
- Allocate computational tasks based on the capacity and reliability of nodes.
- Dynamically adjust resource allocation based on node availability and network conditions.

### Local Data Storage and Processing:
- Store and process local training data on nodes, ensuring data privacy and compliance with regulations.

## role de la blockchain

### Model Versioning and Integrity:
- Store hashes of model versions and their cloud storage addresses, ensuring data integrity and traceability.
- Provide a tamper-proof ledger for tracking model updates and changes.

### Contribution Tracking and Reputation Management:
- Record contributions of each node, including the public keys of participants and their reliability scores.
- Implement smart contracts to manage the reputation system, updating scores based on node performance.

### Consensus and Validation:
- Use blockchain consensus mechanisms to validate transactions and updates related to the training process.
- Ensure that all updates to the model and contributions are verified and consistent across the network.

### Access Control and Security:
- Manage permissions and access controls for who can update or query the blockchain.
- Provide a secure and immutable record of transactions and interactions within the network.

## Interaction entre les deux

### Data Exchange and Synchronization:
- The P2P network can query the blockchain for the latest model hashes and contributor information.
- Upon completion of training tasks, the P2P network updates the blockchain with new model hashes and contributor data.

### Triggering Smart Contracts:
- Nodes in the P2P network can trigger smart contracts on the blockchain to update reputation scores or log training completions.
- Smart contracts can automate certain actions, like creating a new block when a training task is completed.

### APIs for Integration:
- Develop APIs that allow for smooth interaction between the P2P network and the blockchain. For example, an API endpoint on the blockchain to receive updates from the P2P network.
- Ensure secure and authenticated communication between the two systems.

### Event Handling and Notifications:
- Implement event listeners in the P2P network to respond to blockchain updates, like changes in model versions or contributor scores.
- The blockchain can emit events that the P2P network listens to, enabling reactive programming.

### Consistency and Conflict Resolution:
- Implement mechanisms to handle discrepancies between the P2P network data and blockchain records.
- Ensure that both systems maintain a consistent view of the data and state of the training process.


===

- p2p need a coordinator node that collects data and disseminates it to the rest of the network
- autentification method for the nodes to join th network   
- event listener to pull updated data as soon as it's available on the blockchain.
- smart contract to manage the reputation system, updating scores based on node performance.
- consensus mechanism : proof of work
